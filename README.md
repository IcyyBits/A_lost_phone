# A_lost_phone

A small project made by IcyyBits. ðŸ“– 
-
So what is this project about and why it's called a lost phone? ðŸ“± 
Well I have the answers for that (of course I do, I made it, so duh ðŸ« )
Once there was a kid who had a mobile phon- (Everyone: stfu, get to the point)
ðŸ¥² well I just got bored so I made this. there is no explanation for this thing.

Things you can do on this phone (as a player)
-
1. You can admire the looks of the phone. It works both on phone and pc I think
2. You can play 3 different mini games
3. One of thoes mini games is called Memory Mist. It's one of my projects that I added inside of this project. It's not a "Mini" game
4. Puzzles that will make you rage quit if you are a hot head
5. The browser app can browse through everything.

Things you can't do yet (I might update this)
-
1. You can't use the call app and Message app
2. Browser app is usable but you can't use any links to search
3. In the social media app, you can't post. that will be used for posting updates and features in the future
4. The mini games are playable. But you might encounter problems if you use a PC (Since I only have a mobile phone, I couldn't test on pc)

Made on Android using "Code Editor"
I haven't tested it on GitHub pages. So if you come across any problems, you are more than welcome to fix it.
